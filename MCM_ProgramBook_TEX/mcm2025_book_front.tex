\chapter{The Fifteenth International Conference on Monte Carlo and Applications  (MCM 2025) }



% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Welcome}

We are delighted to welcome you to Chicago and Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech) for the \emph{15th International Conference on Monte Carlo and Applications (MCM)}. MCM was last held in the United States twenty years ago and last held in North America eight years ago.  Our Monte Carlo community is truly international, and although videoconferencing is easier than ever, gathering in person promotes greater understanding and insight.

MCM features over 150 presentations, including eight plenary talks,  dozens of special sessions, and many contributed talks.  Our speakers represent a variety of academic backgrounds, institutions, and career stages.  This interplay of perspectives will doubtless spur progress in Monte Carlo.  As a reminder to our speakers, your audience may vary quite a bit in their knowledge of your expertise; please keep this in mind as you speak.

Illinois Tech is a private, research university emphasizing architecture, business, computing, design, engineering, law, and science and letters.  Our roots date to the late 1800s.  From our earliest days we have striven to provide upward educational and economic mobility for our students.  We are proud to be the top university in Illinois and \#32 in the US for lifting or lifting students from families in the bottom 20\% of income to the top 20\%.

Chicago is known for its economic and cultural influence, and we like to think of ourselves as a more pleasant large city.  
While you are visiting here, we hope that you will enjoy our beautiful lakefront, diverse traditions, and cultural attractions. The visitor's guide at \href{https://www.choosechicago.com/articles/bucket-list/first-time-visitors-guide-to-chicago/}{\nolinkurl{www.choosechicago.com/articles/bucket-list/first-time-visitors-guide-to-chicago/}} may be of help.

We wish you a productive and interesting week at MCM 2025! If we can be of help, please approach any of us.

We wish you a productive and interesting week at MCM 2025!
