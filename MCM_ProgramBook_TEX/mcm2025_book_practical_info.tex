\subsection{Covid-19 Rules}

The Covid-19 situation has relaxed considerably over the past months in most of Europe, but there are a few Covid rules that 
we kindly ask you to observe.
\begin{itemize}
 \item Even though there is no strict mask mandate on JKU campus any longer, there is a strong recommendation to wear masks in crowded places. We 
 fully support this recommendation and ask you to \textbf{wear masks} whenever you are within larger groups of people. 
 \textbf{Every conference participant will find an FFP2 mask in their conference kit. Please use it.}
 \item Should you suspect that you might have contracted Covid-19, please \textbf{do not} come to the conference 
 venue \textbf{under any circumstances}, but make yourself known to the conference organizers. Call the Austrian Agency for Health at +43-732-1450, where you 
 will be assisted with organizing a PCR test and all further steps.
 \item If you should show symptoms typical of Covid-19 but are not sure 
 whether you might have Covid or a cold or flu, \textbf{do not} come to the conference until you have a negative PCR test result. 
 \item In any case, please use common sense, and try to help us in keeping MCQMC 2022 Covid-19 free. 

 
\end{itemize}
\fi


%--------------------------------

\subsubsection{Food}

Lunch will \emph{not} be provided. There will be a Tim Horton's (located in the Davis Centre (DC) ground floor), Subway and Flock Stop (both located in the Student Life Center - SLC ground floor), open on-campus during the week providing an inexpensive option for lunch.  
Alternatively, a short 10-minute walk east from STC leads to the ``University Shops Plaza" where there are several restaurants and fast-food outlets providing more diverse options for conference participants. Another popular lunch venue is Ken Sushi House on Phillip Street, just east of campus.

Before you travel to Canada, please ensure you have the proper documents and visitor visas to visit. Check the \href{https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada.html?outside}{Government of Canada website} for specific requirements for your country.

Details regarding travel visas can be found on the \href{https://uwaterloo.ca/monte-carlo-methods-scientific-computing-conference/registration}{registration page}.

Waterloo is located approximately one hour by car from Toronto Pearson Airport, however there are several methods to book travel from the airport to Waterloo.

\begin{itemize}
\item By Bus: There are buses that travel between Toronto Pearson YYZ, to Waterloo. \href{https://www.gotransit.com/en}{GO Transit} is the most popular.
\item By Taxi: With Waterloo Taxi, you can reserve a taxi on the \href{https://waterlootaxi.ca/mobile/airport.php}{Waterloo Taxi online form} or call at +1 (519) 888-7777.
\item By Rail: UP Express is a direct journey from Toronto Pearson International Airport to Union Station, Downtown Toronto. When at Union Station, transfer to \href{https://www.viarail.ca/en}{VIA Rail} train or \href{https://www.gotransit.com/en}{GO train}.
\item By Airways Transit (up to 8 passengers): Reserve door-to-door service on the \href{https://www.airwaystransit.com/Private-Service/}{Airways Transit} website.

By \href{https://www.grt.ca/en/ion-light-rail.aspx}{ION Light Rail} Travel: ION is Waterloo Region’s light rail transit (LRT) system. It runs between Kitchener’s Fairview Park Mall and Waterloo’s Conestoga Mall, with stops at the University of Waterloo campus. ION trains connect passengers to the existing bus system (Grand River Transit), making it easy to travel across the region.



\subsubsection{Equipment in classrooms used for conference}

Each lecture hall is equipped with a desktop computer running Windows,
with USB port access and internet connection, a data projector and screen, 
and blackboards. One MCQMC staff member 
%(with a yellow name tag) 
will be present 
in each lecture hall to assist with IT related issues.

We strongly encourage you to make yourself known to your session chair and (if necessary) 
the MCQMC staff member assigned to your lecture room, prior to your talk. Please prepare your talk in the form of a PDF or PPT document. A slides repository will be created shortly before the conference to facilitate the uploading of slides to the desktop computer in each room prior to each session by MCQMC staff. More detailed instructions will be sent to speakers and session chairs prior to the conference. An alternative option is to bring 
a USB storage device with your slides copied on it and make sure that your talk is copied onto
the desktop computer during the break prior to your talk. 
%We cannot guarantee 
%that other file formats than PDF can be displayed correctly.

If you require access to other software packages or other audio-visual
equipment, please communicate with the conference organizers well ahead of time to
see if it can be arranged. It is possible to connect your personal laptop
to the data projector, but we prefer that you avoid this option due to the
tight conference schedule. If you need to use your own laptop, please make
sure that you discuss this with a MCQMC staff member %assigned to your room 
and 
that you test the connection well before your talk.


\subsubsection{Internet and Computer Access}

University of Waterloo has eduroam to provide free wireless access for visitors whose home
institutions also have eduroam. For more information on eduroam see
\url{http://www.eduroam.org}. Please check with your institution whether you have access to eduroam and
for instructions on how to set up eduroam (this depends on your home
institution and not on local institutions).

If you cannot use eduroam, conference participants will be granted access to the Waterloo wireless network on campus via self-registration. Further details on how to do so will be announced during the opening of the conference. 

%Please note that we are unable to set up new accounts at the conference.

In any case, please use the wireless connections provided responsibly. 



%\subsection{Printing and Photocopying}
