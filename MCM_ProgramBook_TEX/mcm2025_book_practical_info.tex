\section{Technology}

\subsubsection{Equipment in classrooms used for conference}

Each lecture hall is equipped with a desktop computer running Windows,
with USB port access and internet connection, a data projector and screen, 
and blackboards. One MCQMC staff member 
%(with a yellow name tag) 
will be present 
in each lecture hall to assist with IT related issues.

We strongly encourage you to make yourself known to your session chair and (if necessary) 
the MCQMC staff member assigned to your lecture room, prior to your talk. Please prepare your talk in the form of a PDF or PPT document. A slides repository will be created shortly before the conference to facilitate the uploading of slides to the desktop computer in each room prior to each session by MCQMC staff. More detailed instructions will be sent to speakers and session chairs prior to the conference. An alternative option is to bring 
a USB storage device with your slides copied on it and make sure that your talk is copied onto
the desktop computer during the break prior to your talk. 
%We cannot guarantee 
%that other file formats than PDF can be displayed correctly.

If you require access to other software packages or other audio-visual
equipment, please communicate with the conference organizers well ahead of time to
see if it can be arranged. It is possible to connect your personal laptop
to the data projector, but we prefer that you avoid this option due to the
tight conference schedule. If you need to use your own laptop, please make
sure that you discuss this with a MCQMC staff member %assigned to your room 
and 
that you test the connection well before your talk.


\subsubsection{Internet and Computer Access}

University of Waterloo has eduroam to provide free wireless access for visitors whose home
institutions also have eduroam. For more information on eduroam see
\url{http://www.eduroam.org}. Please check with your institution whether you have access to eduroam and
for instructions on how to set up eduroam (this depends on your home
institution and not on local institutions).

If you cannot use eduroam, conference participants will be granted access to the Waterloo wireless network on campus via self-registration. Further details on how to do so will be announced during the opening of the conference. 

%Please note that we are unable to set up new accounts at the conference.

In any case, please use the wireless connections provided responsibly.
