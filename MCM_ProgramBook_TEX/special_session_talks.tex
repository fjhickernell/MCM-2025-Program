  Large-scale optimization problems based on partial differential equation models typically involve a number of uncertainties: for example, the material parameters, domain shape or sensor locations used to collect the measurements may not be perfectly known. The quantification of these uncertainties leads to challenging high-dimensional integration problems, which can be tackled efficiently using, e.g., multilevel Monte Carlo or quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The intersection of optimization and uncertainty quantification is an actively developing field of research, and this session aims to cover some recent advances in the computational and theoretical treatment of these topics.

 Common tasks in stochastic modeling include model calibration and sensitivity analysis. These tasks typically require many model evaluations, which can be prohibitively expensive in case model evaluations are costly. This has motivated the development of surrogate models, which are fit offline on a limited budget and then enable rapid online evaluations for predictive purposes. An important decision is where to evaluate the model in order to maximize information captured by the surrogate. While Monte Carlo points are a conventional choice, their independent nature often leads to sampling in locations of little value to the surrogate. In contrast, dependent structures, such as quasi-random (low discrepancy) points or Bayesian optimal experimental designs, have proven to produce more reliable surrogate models. This session will discuss some of the recent developments in these sampling techniques, and will bring together researchers from both communities to explore collaborations.

Rare events are events with small probabilities, but their occurrences are critical in many real-life applications. The problem of estimating rare event probabilities is encountered in various engineering applications (finance, wireless communications, system reliability, Biology, etc.). Naive Monte Carlo simulations are, in this case, substantially expensive. This session focuses on methods belonging to the class of variance reduction techniques. These alternative methods deliver, when appropriately used, accurate estimates with a substantial amount of variance reduction compared to the naive Monte Carlo estimator.

 One of the most common approaches to modelling physical phenomena consists of ordinary and partial differential equations, which allow for computer simulations through the use of modern numerical solvers. These models encompass parameters that often have to be measured or inferred from data. To account for error measurements and scarce availability of the data, we express our uncertainty about the parameters by associating, for example, a probability distribution to them. This mini-symposium focuses on recent advances in algorithms for quantifying the uncertainty in such models.

 {}% [9] third organizer, if any
 The standard perspective on numerical analysis deals with solving individual numerical tasks, but in practice the experience gained from using numerical methods to solve related problems provides valuable insight into their performance, which can shape how and when numerical methods are used.
 Developments at the intersection of probability, statistics, and numerical analysis seek to leverage experience to improve performance on subsequent numerical tasks as they are encountered.
 This session will shine a light on emerging methodology for the solution of related integration problems, arising in areas of research that include sensitivity analysis, computational finance, the solution of partial differential equations, decision-making under uncertainty, and diffusion-based generative modelling.
 Fran\c{c}ois-Xavier Briol from University College London will present a probabilistic approach to estimating related conditional expectations, which operates by sharing statistical information regarding the integrand.
 Jon Cockayne from the University of Southampton will present a novel statistical approach to solving related linear systems of equations, such as occur when integrating a partial differential equation that is parameter-dependent.
 Zheyang Shen from Newcastle University will present a novel perspective on diffusion-based generative modelling, which casts the problem of generating realistic image data as the estimation of related kernel mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space framework.

Recently, there has been much progress in understanding the power of different types of information (function values vs.\ linear measurements, optimal vs.\ random)
as well as different classes of algorithms (linear vs.\ nonlinear, random vs.\ deterministic, adaptive vs.\ nonadaptive), but also with regard to the error analysis for specific recovery schemes.
The session is concerned with these new developments, which also include the impact of a large dimension, discretization in function spaces and modern methods in data science.

 Pseudorandom number generators are a core part of scientific computing, lying at the foundation of Monte Carlo methods. Over the history of the field, the quality of such generators has consistently been improved to produce streams of numbers that are hard to distinguish from truly random numbers. There are two approaches to quantify the randomness of a given generator. On the one hand, one can use mathematical techniques to determine the theoretical properties of the generator such as period length, uniformity, and sequence correlation. On the other hand, one can apply statistical benchmarks to empirically test the streams produced by a generator. This minisymposium aims to bring together researchers working on the design and testing of practical random number generators to exchange ideas on how to make use of these two complementary approaches in their evaluation.

 In the literature on QMC and related methods, it is often the case that one can tailor an algorithm to a specific problem, usually depending on a certain (fixed) choice
 of problem parameters such as smoothness parameters or coordinate weights. This may
 have the advantage that one obtains an excellent algorithm for this particular problem,
 but the obvious downside is that it is not clear whether the same algorithm could be applied in other settings, e.g., when some of the parameters change. There have been recent attempts to make QMC and related algorithms more universal, and a number of interesting open questions remain. This special session brings together four speakers who have recently contributed to this aspect of multivariate algorithms.

 As Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods become more complex, a deeper understanding of their convergence and performance guarantees in realistic scenarios becomes an important aspect of using these methods in computational Bayesian statistics. This session aims to further this understanding by focusing on the convergence and robustness of complex MCMC samplers, covering recent work on topics such as convergence of hybrid Gibbs sampling [1], novel methods for evaluation of convergence rates using random number simulations [2] the study of convergence with Dirichlet forms [3] as well as techniques for making MCMC samplers more robust and a study of their corresponding convergence properties, such as [4].

 Langevin Monte Carlo methods — such as MALA and ULA [3] — construct a Monte Carlo Markov chain by appropriately discretising certain stochastic differential equations.
 This has the fortunate effect that certain properties of the resulting MCMC algorithms can be derived by studying these SDEs rather than the arising discrete-time Markov chains.
 The idea of analysing an underlying continuous-time system to understand a discrete-time algorithm is much broader and shall be one focus of this minisymposium – with `algorithm’,
 we foremost want to focus on methods in computational statistics, but also look forward to optimisation methods, such as [2], data assimilation, diffusion models, and partial differential equation
 methods in data science. The second focus are Monte Carlo methods that are both posed and used in continuous time, such as piecewise-deterministic Markov processes (cf. [1]).

  High- and infinite-dimensional problems pose serious challenges in numerical practice. An approach to surpass these obstacles is to identify common structural features of the underlying problems. These features are usually encoded in the specific function spaces that are considered in the analysis.
  In this special session we want to bring together researchers from analysis, approximation theory, and information-based complexity to discuss different types of function spaces and algorithmic approaches for high- and infinite-dimensional integration and approximation problems.
