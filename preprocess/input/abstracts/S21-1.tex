In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation of a deep policy gradient method (PGM) for stochastic optimal control problems in continuous time. The proposed method has the ability to distribute the allocation of computational resources, i.e., the number of Monte Carlo  sample paths of a controlled diffusion process and complexity of the neural network architecture, more efficiently and improves performance for certain continuous-time problems that require a fine time discretization to achieve a desired accuracy. At each step of the method, we train a policy, modeled by a neural network, for a discretized optimal control problem in a different time scale. The first step has the coarsest time discretization. As we proceed to further steps, the time grid renders finer and a new policy is trained on the finer time scale. We provide a theoretical result on efficiency gained by this method and conclude the paper by numerical experiments on a linear-quadratic stochastic optimal control problem.
