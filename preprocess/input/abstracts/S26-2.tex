The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is commonly used to sample probability distributions in extremely high-dimensional settings. However, existing analyses of the algorithm for strongly log-concave distributions suggest that, as the dimension $d$ of the problem increases, the number of iterations required to ensure convergence within a desired error in the $W_2$ metric scales in proportion to $d$ or $\sqrt{d}$. In this work, we argue that, the behavior for a \emph{small number} of variables can be significantly better: a number of iterations proportional to $K$, up to logarithmic terms in $d$,
often suffices for the algorithm to converge to within a desired $W_2$ error for all $K$-marginals.
We refer to this effect as 
\textit{delocalization of bias}. 
We show that the delocalization effect does not hold universally and prove its validity for Gaussian distributions and strongly log-concave distributions with certain sparse/local interactions. Our analysis relies on a novel $W_{2,\ell^\infty}$ metric to measure convergence. A key technical challenge we address is the lack of a one-step contraction property in this metric. Finally, we use asymptotic arguments to explore potential generalizations of the delocalization effect beyond the Gaussian and sparse/local interactions setting.
