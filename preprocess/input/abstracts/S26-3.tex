The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is widely used for sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions. It is well known to be biased, with the bias as measured in squared Wasserstein-2 distance scaling linearly with the dimension. However, the remarkable recent work [1] has revealed a \textit{delocalization of bias} effect: For a class of distributions with \textit{sparse interactions}, the bias between lower-dimensional marginals scales only with the lower dimension, not the full dimension.Â In this work, we strengthen the results of [1] in the sparse interaction regime by removing a logarithmic factor, measuring distance in KL-divergence, and relaxing the strong log-concavity assumption. In addition, we expand the scope of the delocalization phenomenon by showing that it holds for a different class of distributions, with \textit{weak interactions}. Our proofs are based on a hierarchical analysis of the KL-divergence between marginals.
