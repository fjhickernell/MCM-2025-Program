Given $X$, some measurable subset of Euclidean space, one sometimes wants to construct a design, $P\subset X$ with a small energy or discrepancy. It is known that these two measures of design quality are equivalent when they are defined via positive definite kernels $K:X^2\to \mathbb R$. Our talk studies discrepancy and energy in the case when $X$ is the orbit of a compact, possibly non-Abelian group, $G$, acting as measurable transformations of $X$ and the kernel $K$ is invariant under the group action. For example, our results apply to the sphere, flat torus and Riesz kernel. It is shown that the minimizer measure for the energy is the normalized measure on $X$ induced by Haar measure on $G$. This allows us to calculate upper bounds on discrepancy. We will explain how this problem relates to interactions of neural data in the subject of Neural Science, Whitney extensions and manifold learning alignment .
