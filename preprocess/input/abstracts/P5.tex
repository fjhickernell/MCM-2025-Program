A fundamental question in stochastic modelling is that of quantifying the effects of model uncertainty. In this context it is of interest to compute a distance between different stochastic models. A  reasonable choice of distance is a modification of the Wasserstein distance on the space of probability measures called adapted Wasserstein distance, as it appears in bicausal optimal transport.

	We solve constrained optimal transport problems in which the marginal laws are given by the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. Numerical methods are employed as a theoretical tool to bound the adapted Wasserstein distance. This opens the door for computing the adapted Wasserstein distance in a simple way. We show that this method can be applied to quantifying model uncertainty in stochastic optimisation problems. 	
	
	Our approach successfully brings together optimal transport and numerical analysis of SDEs.
