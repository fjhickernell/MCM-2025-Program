				% Insert the title of the special session if you were invited to give a talk in a special session.

In this talk we present an adaptive approximation scheme for jump-diffusion SDEs with discontinuous drift and (possibly) degenerate diffusion. The scheme is a transformation-based doubly-adaptive quasi-Milstein scheme, which 
is doubly-adaptive in the sense that it is jump-adapted, i.e.~all jump times of the Poisson noise are grid points, and it includes an adaptive stepsize strategy to account for the discontinuities of the drift. It is proven to have strong convergence rate $1$ in $L^p$ for $p\in[1,\infty)$ with respect to the average computational cost for these SDEs. 
To obtain our result, we prove that under slightly stronger assumptions which are still weaker than those in existing literature, a related doubly-adaptive quasi-Milstein scheme has convergence order $1$.
