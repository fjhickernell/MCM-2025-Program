We consider $d$-dimensional systems of SDEs with a discontinuous drift coefficient. More precisely,
we assume that there exists a $C^{5}$-hypersurface
$\Theta\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that the drift coefficient is intrinsic Lipschitz continuous on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\setminus \Theta$ and has intrinsic Lipschitz continuous derivative on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\setminus \Theta$.
Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient is $C^{1}$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and commutative with a bounded derivative that is intrinsic Lipschitz continuous on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\setminus \Theta$.

It was proven in [1] for $d = 1$ and more recently in [2] for general $d \in \mathbb{N}$ that in this setting a transformed Milstein scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $3/4-$ in terms of the number of evaluations of the
driving Brownian motion.
Furthermore it was proven in [3] that for $d = 1$ in the same setting an adaptive Milstein-type scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $1$ in terms of the average number of evaluations of the driving Brownian motion. 

In this talk we present a generalisation of the result from [3] to higher dimensions. More precisely, we introduce an adaptive transformed Milstein scheme which can be used for the approximation of solutions of $d$-dimensional systems of SDEs at the final time point in this setting and
prove that this scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $1$ in terms of the average number of evaluations of the
driving Brownian motion.
