Stochastic differential equations driven by L{\'e}vy processes have become established as models to describe the evolution of random variables such as financial and economic variables and more recently of climate variables, when the stochastic system shows jump discontinuities. In this talk, we derive a novel series representation of the flowmap of such stochastic 
differential equations 
in terms of commutators of vector fields with stochastic 
coefficients, in other words a Chen--Strichartz formula. We provide an explicit expression for the components in this series. 
Our results extend previous results
for deterministic and continuous stochastic differential equations.
