In the era of generative models, statistical inference based on classical likelihood for such models has faced a challenge. This is due to highly nontrivial model structures and thus computing the likelihood functions is almost impossible. Often time, information on these generative models can only be obtained by sampling from the models but the necessity of sampling can further pose a tradeoff between computational burden and statistical accuracy. In this talk, we propose a framework for statistical inference for generative models leveraging the techniques from (Quasi-)Monte Carlo. Despite the unavoidable balance of statistical accuracy and computation, both computational and statistical performances can be boosted by employing (Quasi-)Monte Carlo techniques. The presentation will be based on two papers.
