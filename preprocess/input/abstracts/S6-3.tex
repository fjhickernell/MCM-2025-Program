In this talk, we present a novel approach for sequential optimal experimental design (sOED) for Bayesian inverse problems governed by expensive forward models with large-dimensional unknown parameters. Our goal is to design experiments that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) from prior to posterior, a task that is computationally challenging. This task becomes more complex in sOED, where we must approximate the incremental expected information gain (iEIG) multiple times in distinct stages, often dealing with intractable prior and posterior distributions. To address this, we propose a derivative-based upper bound for iEIG that guides experimental design and enables parameter dimension reduction through likelihood-informed subspaces. By combining this approach with transport map surrogates for the sequence of posteriors, we develop a unified framework for parameter dimension-reduced sOED. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with numerical examples inspired by groundwater flow and photoacoustic imaging.
