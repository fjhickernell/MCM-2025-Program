The stochastic representation to the solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) and integral equations (IEs) has been known for decades.  These representations have lead to a variety of Monte Carlo methods for the numerical solution of both PDEs and IEs, among them is a method called the Walk on Spheres (WoS) algorithm.  WoS has been quite successful in solving linear elliptic and parabolic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary conditions in a very cost effective way.  This numerical analysis work was taken up by the computer graphics community, who are experts in Monte Carlo through their use of it in image rendering via ray tracing.  Their interest stems from the fact that WoS and ray tracing both permit the representation of the geometry of the problem in a very compact and computational efficient way via Bounding Volume Hierarchy.  This has lead to the expansion of the scope and efficiency of WoS in a wide variety of ways which will be presented here.
