				% Insert the title of the special session if you were invited to give a talk in a special session.

Given an unnormalized density $\rho$ and a constraint set $\Sigma$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we aim at sampling from a constrained distribution $Z^{-1} \rho(x) I_{\Sigma}(x) dx$. While the case when $\Sigma$ is convex has been extensively studied, \emph{no} convexity is needed in this talk, in which case quantitative results are scarce. % The case when the density is described by first-order oracles and the constraint set is described by a collection of equalities and inequalities will be considered. 
Our method admits multiple interpretations, but this talk will focus on a Langevin perspective, where overdamped Langevin dynamics is first modified, and then discretized so that a sampling algorithm can be constructed. The quantitative convergence of the continuous dynamics will be detailed, but if time permits, the performance of the time-discretization (i.e. the actual sampler) will also be discussed.

%\textbf{[Revised version]}
%Consider an unnormalized density $\rho$ and a constraint set $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ defined by finitely many equality and inequality constraints. We aim to sample from the target density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \rho(x)I_{\Sigma}(x) dx$. While the case when $\Sigma$ is convex has been extensively studied, traditional approaches for nonconvex $\Sigma$ have heuristically relied on projection operators or on designing algorithms that steer trajectories along directions orthogonal to $\Sigma$ (e.g., landing algorithms or orthogonal direction samplers). However, these methods are typically limited to equality constraints, and even in that setting, rigorous analyses of convergence rates remain scarce. In contrast, we propose a new framework that can design an overdamped Langevin dynamics which accommodates both equality and inequality constraints without relying slack variable method. The modified dynamics also deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. Additionally, we introduce a heuristic hard landing algorithm to address challenges arising from discretization. Under suitable regularity conditions on $\rho$ and $\Sigma$, we prove that the continuous dynamics converge exponentially fast to $\rho_\Sigma$.
