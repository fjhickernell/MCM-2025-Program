  Randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods benefit from smoothness
  in the integrand.  In some applications, one of the input variables takes
  only a modest finite number $L\geqslant2$
of values and can be considered a categorical
  variable. Such a variable introduces a discontinuity in the integrand.  It is
  an RQMC-friendly discontinuity because the discontinuity is axis parallel
  when each level of the categorical variable corresponds to a single
  sub-interval of $[0,1]$.  A naturally occuring use case has
  the categorical variable correspond to a component in a distribution
  that is a mixture of $L$ other distributions.  Within the mixture
  setting, mixture importance sampling is a prominent example.

 If category $\ell$  has probability $\alpha_\ell$ in the motivating
  model then it would naturally get an interval of width $\alpha_\ell$.
If the RQMC method uses scrambled Sobol' points
then we can make the problem even more RQMC-friendly by instead giving
  level $\ell$ an interval of width $\beta_\ell = 2^{-\kappa_\ell}$
  for some integers $\kappa_\ell \geqslant1$ and then
  incorporating sampling ratios $\alpha_\ell/\beta_\ell$.
  These $\beta_\ell$ are negative powers of $2$ that sum to $1$.
  The number of ways to choose $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_L$
  as a function of $L$ is given by sequence A002572 in the
  online encyclopedia of integer sequences.

  Under usual assumptions on the convergence rates for RQMC
  estimates, we find that the asymptotically optimal $\beta_\ell$
  are more nearly equal than the original $\alpha_\ell$ are.
  We find some rules for making that  allocation under uncertainty
  about the appropriate RQMC rate.

  The mixing problem was studied by [1] where they use instead
  $L$ different QMC samples instead of one sample in which
  one of the variables yields $\ell$. The first QMC variable
  was used by [2] to allocate points to different processors
  in parallel computing.
