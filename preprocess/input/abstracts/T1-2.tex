Markov chain sampling methods form the backbone of modern computational statistics.
However, many popular methods are prone to random walk behaviour, i.e.\@{} diffusion-like exploration of the sample space, leading to slow mixing that requires intricate tuning to alleviate.
Non-reversible samplers can resolve some of these issues.
We introduce a device that turns jump processes that satisfy a skew-detailed balance condition for a reference measure into a process that samples a target measure that is absolutely continuous with respect to the reference measure.
This sampler is rejection-free, non-reversible and time-continuous.
As an example, we apply the device to Hamiltonian dynamics discretized by the leapfrog integrator, resulting in a rejection-free non-reversible time-continuous version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).
We prove the geometric ergodicity of the resulting sampler, and demonstrate its increased robustness to hyperparameter tuning compared to HMC through numerical examples.
This comes at a computational cost at worst double that of HMC, in practice lower than other popular non-reversible samplers such as the Bouncy Particle Sampler.
