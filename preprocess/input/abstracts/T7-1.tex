The Gibbs sampler (GS) is a fundamental algorithm for approximating analytically intractable distributions.
Two major generalizations of GS are the partially collapsed Gibbs sampler (PCGS) and the pseudo-Gibbs sampler (PGS). For PCGS, the associated Markov chain is heterogeneous with varying state spaces, making traditional convergence analysis challenging. To address this, we introduce the iterative conditional replacement (ICR) algorithm and prove its convergence. Furthermore, ICR provides a systematic approach for approximating multiple stationary distributions arising in PGS.
Our approach emphasizes the advantage of treating each conditional density with its own operator, rather than aggregating all conditionals into a single operator.
