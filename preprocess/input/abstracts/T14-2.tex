The performance of MCMC samplers tends to depend on various properties of the target distribution, such as its covariance structure, the location of its probability mass, and its tail behavior. We propose \textit{parallel affine transformation tuning} (PATT) [1], a methodological framework that relies on bijective affine transformations, a latent space construction, the adaptive MCMC principle, and interacting parallel chains, and acts as an intermediate layer between the target distribution and an MCMC method applied to it. By transforming a challenging target into a simpler one, PATT can harness the full potential of the underlying MCMC method.

According to our numerical experiments, PATT is particularly effective in its combinations with \textit{elliptical slice sampling} (ESS) [2] and \textit{Gibbsian polar slice sampling} (GPSS) [3]. For targets that are sufficiently well-behaved (e.g.~posteriors in Bayesian logistic regression), these combinations produce samples of (empirically) dimension-independent quality at remarkably low computational cost, with PATT-ESS performing best for light-tailed targets and PATT-GPSS being the superior choice for heavy-tailed ones.
