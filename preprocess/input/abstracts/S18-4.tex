Many common Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) kernels can be formulated using a deterministic involutive proposal with a step size parameter.  Selecting an appropriate step size is often a challenging task in practice; and for complex multiscale targets, there may not be one choice of step size that works well globally.  In this talk I'll address this problem with a novel class of involutive MCMC methods---AutoStep MCMC---that selects an appropriate step size at each iteration adapted to the local geometry of the target distribution.  I'll present theoretical results guaranteeing that under mild conditions AutoStep MCMC is $\pi$-invariant, irreducible, and aperiodic, and provides bounds on expected energy jump distance and cost per iteration. The talk will conclude with empirical results examining the robustness and efficacy of the proposed step size selection procedure.
