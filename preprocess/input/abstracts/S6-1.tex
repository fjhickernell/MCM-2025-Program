We explore the stability properties of utility functions in Bayesian optimal experimental design, introducing novel utilities inspired by the analysis . We establish a general framework to study the behavior of expected utility under perturbations in infinite-dimensional setting and prove its convergence properties. Our results provide theoretical guarantees for the robustness of Bayesian design criteria and offer insights into their practical applicability in complex experimental settings.
