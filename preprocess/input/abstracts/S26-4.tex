In recent years, we witnessed considerable progress on the quantitative mixing of Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via variational hypocoercivity and lifts. Under assumptions revolving around the concentration of measure phenomenon, it was shown that critically tuned Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo achieves accelerated convergence to equilibrium, also known as the diffusive-to-ballistic speed-up. This acceleration is of great interest to the field of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. To bridge the gap between theory and application, a natural question is: {\it Does the No-U-turn sampler, a widely used locally-adapted implementation of Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, achieve acceleration?} We will explore recent results towards this question based on a combination of concentration of measure and a novel framework for localized mixing via couplings.
