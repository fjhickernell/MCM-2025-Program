  Drawing samples distributed according to a given unnormalized probability density function is a common task in Bayesian inverse problems. Algorithms based on an ensemble of interacting \emph{particles}, moving in parameter space, are gaining in popularity for these problems since they are often parallelizable, derivative-free, and affine-invariant. However, most are only accurate for near-Gaussian target distributions; an example is the consensus-based sampling (CBS) method [1]. We propose a novel way to derive CBS from ensemble-preconditioned Langevin diffusions by first approximating the target potential by its anisotropic Moreau envelope, then approximating the proximal operator by a weighted mean, and finally assuming that the initial and target distributions are Gaussian. We adapt these approximations with non-Gaussian distributions in mind and arrive at a new interacting-particle method for sampling, which we call \emph{localized consensus-based sampling}. Numerical tests illustrate that localized CBS compares favorably to alternative methods in terms of affine-invariance and performance on non-Gaussian distributions.
