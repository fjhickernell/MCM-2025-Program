Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with infinite variance gradients arises, perhaps surprisingly, quite often in applications. Even in settings involving “finite variance” in theory, infinite variance models appear to provide a better statistical fit over spatial and temporal scales of interest in applied settings. Motivated by this, we investigate a general methodology that enables the development of valid confidence regions for SGD with infinite variance. Along the way, we also obtain key results and properties for SGD with infinite variance, for example, asymptotic limits, optimal convergence rates, etc., which are counterparts of celebrated results known only in the finite variance case.
