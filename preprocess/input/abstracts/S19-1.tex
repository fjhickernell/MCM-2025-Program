Stochastic optimization problems arise in a wide range of applications, from acoustic/geophysical inversion to deep learning. The scale, computational cost, and difficulty of these models make classical optimization techniques impractical. To address these challenges, in this talk, we propose new stochastic optimization methods using Monte Carlo-based adaptive sampling approaches. These approaches adaptively control the accuracy in the stochastic approximations at each iteration of the optimization algorithm by controlling the sample sizes used in these approximations to achieve efficiency and scalability. Furthermore, these approaches are well-suited for distributed computing implementations. We show that these approaches achieve optimal theoretical global convergence and complexity results for strongly convex, general convex, and non-convex problems and illustrate our algorithm's performance on machine learning models.
