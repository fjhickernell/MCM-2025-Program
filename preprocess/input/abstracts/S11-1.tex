We propose a framework for computing, optimizing and integrating with respect to
a smooth marginal likelihood in statistical models that involve high-dimensional parameters/latent
variables and continuous low-dimensional hyperparameters. The method requires samples from
the posterior distribution of the parameters for different values of the hyperparameters on a simulation grid and returns inference on the marginal likelihood defined everywhere on its domain,
and on its functionals. We explain the relationship between the method and many of the methods that have been
used in this context, including sequential Monte Carlo, Gibbs sampling, Monte Carlo maximum
likelihood, and umbrella sampling. We establish the consistency of the proposed estimators as
the sampling effort increases, both when the simulation grid is kept fixed and when it becomes
dense in the domain. We showcase the approach on Gaussian process regression and classification and crossed effect models.
