Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) problems often involve nested integrals, making their direct computation challenging. To address this, a one-shot optimization approach is proposed, which decouples the design parameters from the forward model during the optimization process. In addition, the solution of the forward model can be replaced by a surrogate that is trained during the one-shot optimization. This allows for the generation of computationally inexpensive samples. Efficient sampling strategies are particularly important in BOED, as they reduce the high computational cost of nested integration, ultimately making the optimization more tractable.
