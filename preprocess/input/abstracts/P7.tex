In ecological inference, one wishes to model individual items, but perform
inference based only on aggregate data.  For instance, in two-round elections,
we are interested the behaviour of individual voters, but only have access to
aggregate vote numbers at each precinct.  We develop an exact method for a
large class of Ecological Inference Bayesian models, which scales  to the large
data setting.  Our approach solves a more general problem:  assuming $X$ is a
random vector and $A$ a non-invertible matrix, one sometimes need to perform
inference while only having access to samples of $Y=AX$. The corresponding
likelihood is typically intractable. One may still be able to perform exact
Bayesian inference using a pseudo-marginal sampler, but this requires an
unbiased estimator of the intractable likelihood.

We propose saddlepoint Monte Carlo, a method for obtaining an unbiased estimate
of the density of $Y$ with very low variance, for any model belonging to an
exponential family. Our method relies on importance sampling and 
characteristic functions, with insights brought by the standard saddlepoint
approximation scheme with exponential tilting.  We show that saddlepoint Monte
Carlo makes it possible to perform exact inference on particularly challenging
problems and datasets.  We present a study of the carryover of votes between
the two rounds of various French elections, using the finest available data
(number of votes for each candidate in about 60,000 polling stations over most
of the French territory). 

We show that existing, popular approximate methods for ecological inference can
lead to substantial bias; saddlepoint Monte Carlo is immune from this bias, and 
can handle ecological inference in the large data framework. We also
present original results for the 2024 legislative elections on political
centre-to-left and left-to-centre conversion rates when the far-right is
present in the second round. Finally, we discuss other exciting applications
for saddlepoint Monte Carlo in privacy and inverse problems, such as dealing
with inference with empirical quantiles for continuous data.
