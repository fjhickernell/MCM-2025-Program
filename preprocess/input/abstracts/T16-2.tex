Permutation tests are a popular choice for distinguishing distributions and testing independence, due to their exact, finite-sample control of false positives and their minimax optimality when paired with U-statistics. However, standard permutation tests are also expensive, requiring a test statistic to be computed hundreds or thousands of times to detect a separation between distributions. In this work, we offer a simple approach to accelerate testing: group your datapoints into bins and permute only those bins. For U and V-statistics, we prove that these cheap permutation tests have two remarkable properties. First, by storing appropriate sufficient statistics, a cheap test can be run in time comparable to evaluating a single test statistic. Second, cheap permutation power closely approximates standard permutation power. As a result, cheap tests inherit the exact false positive control and minimax optimality of standard permutation tests while running in a fraction of the time. We complement these findings with improved power guarantees for standard permutation testing and experiments demonstrating the benefits of cheap permutations over standard maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), random Fourier feature, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, cross-MMD, and cross-HSIC tests.
