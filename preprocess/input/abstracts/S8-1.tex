Under some confluence assumption, it is known that the stationary distribution of a McKean-Vlasov SDE is the limit of the empirical measure of its associated self-interacting diffusion. 
Our numerical method consists in introducing the Euler scheme with decreasing step size of this self-interacting diffusion and seeing its empirical measure as the approximation of the stationary distribution of the original McKean-Vlasov SDEs.
This simple approach is successful (under some raisonnable assumptions...) as we are able to prove convergence with a rate for the Wasserstein distance between the two measures both in the L2 and almost sure sense. In this talk, I will first explain the rationale behind this approach and  I will discuss the various convergence results we have obtained so far.
