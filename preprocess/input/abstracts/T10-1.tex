We investigate the mixing properties of the stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) algorithm with a fixed step size. While most existing studies on SGLD assume an i.i.d. data stream, this assumption is often unrealistic in practical applications, such as financial time series analysis, natural language processing, and sensor data processing. In such settings, the sequence of iterates no longer forms a Markov chain, significantly complicating the mathematical analysis [1, 2].

To address this challenge, we model the iterates as a Markov chain in a random environment (see [4, 5], and [6]). Under standard dissipativity and Lipschitz conditions, we establish the transfer of $\alpha$-mixing properties from the data stream to the sequence of iterates [3]. This enables us to derive key theoretical results, including the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem, and concentration inequalities for SGLD in the non-convex setting. Our findings provide theoretical guarantees for SGLD in a more realistic scenario where the data merely weakly dependent.
