Approximating a probability distribution using a set of particles is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics, with applications including  quantization and optimal design. Formally, we seek a finite weighted mixture of Dirac measures that best approximates the target distribution. While much existing work relies on the Wasserstein distance to quantify approximation errors, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has received comparatively less attention, especially when allowing for variable particle weights. We study the quantization problem from the perspective of minimizing MMD via gradient flow in the Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao (WFR) geometry. This gradient flow yields an ODE system from which we further derive a fixed-point algorithm called \emph{mean shift interacting particles} (MSIP). We show that MSIP extends the non-interacting mean shift algorithm, widely used for identifying modes in kernel density estimates. Moreover, we show that MSIP can be interpreted as preconditioned gradient descent, and that it acts as a relaxation of Lloyd's algorithm for clustering. 
Our numerical experiments demonstrate that MSIP and the WFR ODEs outperform other algorithms for quantization of multi-modal and high-dimensional targets.
