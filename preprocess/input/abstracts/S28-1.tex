Investigating the dynamics of growing cell populations is crucial for unraveling key biological mechanisms in living organisms, with many important applications in therapeutics and biochemical engineering. Classical agent-based simulation algorithms are often inefficient for these systems because
they track each individual cell, making them impractical for fast (or even exponentially) growing
cell populations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel stochastic simulation approach
based on a Feynman-Kac-like representation of the population dynamics. This method, named the
Feynman-Kac-inspired Gillespieâ€™s Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (FKG-SSA), always employs a
fixed number of independently simulated cells for Monte Carlo computation of the system, resulting in a constant computational complexity regardless of the population size. Furthermore, we
theoretically show the statistical consistency of the proposed method, indicating its accuracy and
reliability. Finally, a couple of biologically relevant numerical examples are presented to illustrate the
approach. Overall, the proposed FKG-SSA effectively addresses the challenge of simulating growing
cell populations, providing a solid foundation for better analysis of these systems.
