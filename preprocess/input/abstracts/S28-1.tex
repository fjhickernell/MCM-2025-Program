Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A key challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a system filtering equation. The current numerical methods, such as the Filtered Finite State Projection [1], are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To overcome this, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems [2]. In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator [3]. The novel method employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space, improving computational efficiency over existing methods.
