A Stochastic Reaction Network (SRN) is a continuous-time, discrete-space Markov chain that models the random interaction of $d$ species through reactions, commonly applied in bio-chemical systems. We are interested in efficiently estimating rare event probabilities, where we consider path-dependent observables. Therefore, we present an importance sampling (IS) method based on the discrete Tau-Leap (TL) scheme to enhance the performance of Monte Carlo (MC) estimators. The primary challenge in IS is selecting an appropriate change of probability measure to significantly reduce variance, which often requires deep insights into the underlying problem. To address this, we propose a generic approach to obtain an efficient path-dependent measure change, based on an original connection between finding optimal IS parameters and solving a variance minimization problem using a stochastic optimal control (SOC) formulation [1]. The optimal IS parameters can be derived by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

To address the curse of dimensionality, we propose the Markovian Projection (MP) technique to reduce the SRN to a lower-dimensional SRN (called MP-SRN) while preserving the marginal distribution of the original high-dimensional system. When solving the resulting SOC problem numerically to derive the variance reducing IS parameters, we derive the parameter for a reduced-dimensional model. These IS parameters can be applied to the full-dimensional SRN in the forward run. Analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that our IS strategies substantially reduce the variance of the MC estimator, leading to lower computational complexity in the rare event regime compared to standard MC methods. 

At the end of the talk, we give a small outlook on a multilevel-IS scheme to further improve the efficiency of the estimator.
