In many rare-event simulation problems, an estimand is expressed  as a smooth function of several quantities,  each
estimated by simulation  but not necessarily all of their estimators are critically influenced by
the rarity of the event of interest.  
An example arises in the estimation of the mean time to failure of a regenerative system, usually expressed as the ratio of two quantities to be estimated, the denominator being the only one  entailing a rare event in a highly reliable context.

In general, there has been to our knowledge no work investigating  the efficiency  of estimating $\alpha = g({\boldsymbol{\theta}})$
for some known  smooth function $g : \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}$ and where ${\boldsymbol{\theta}} = (\theta_1, \theta_2, \ldots, \theta_d) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a vector of unknown parameters, for some $d \geq 1$, each  estimated by simulation.

We will provide during the talk conditions under which having efficient estimators of each individual mean leads to an efficient estimator of the function of the means. Our conditions are described for several asymptotic robustness properties: logarithmic efficiency, bounded relative error and vanishing relative error.
We illustrate this setting through several examples, and numerical results complement the theory.
