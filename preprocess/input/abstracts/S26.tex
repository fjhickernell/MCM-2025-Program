% Many Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers follow certain stochastic dynamics. Unadjust Langevin algorithm provides a conceptual starting point for a giant family of extensions, which include the kinetic/underdamped Langevin, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS).

Many Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers are based on stochastic dynamics. Langevin dynamics serves as a fundamental basis for a vast family of extensions, such as unadjusted Langevin algorithms, kinetic/underdamped Langevin algorithms, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). The gradient flow structure of Langevin dynamics also motivates the development of a large class of novel algorithms such as stein variational gradient descent, birth-death process approaches, and those based on Fisher-Rao gradient flows. These methods have become ubiquitous across various fields, including molecular dynamics, Bayesian statistics, and machine learning. Recent years have seen significant theoretical advances in analyzing such methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings and non-convex cases. This special session aims to bring together researchers from different communities (probability, statistics, scientific computing, theoretical computer science, machine learning, etc.)\ working on analysis of sampling dynamics of Langevin and beyond to present recent progress, discuss challenges, and share ideas.

[\textbf{To conference organizers}: One of our speakers in our two-part sessions has other commitment until July 30. Thus, we prefer both of our sessions to be scheduled during July 31 -- Aug 1. July 30 is also acceptable if the later dates are impossible. We really appreciate your help to make our sessions possible.]
