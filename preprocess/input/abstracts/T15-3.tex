Negatively weighted events, which appear in the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of particle collisions, significantly increase the computational resource requirements of current and future collider experiments in high energy physics. This work introduces an MC technique called ARCANE reweighting for reducing or eliminating negatively weighted events. The technique works by redistributing (via an additive reweighting) the contributions of different pathways within the simulator that lead to the same final event. The technique is exact and does not introduce any biases in the distributions of physical observables. ARCANE reweighting can be thought of as a variant of the parametrized control variates technique, with the added nuance that redistribution is performed using a deferred additive reweighting. The technique is demonstrated for the simulation of a specific collision process, namely $e^+ e^- \longrightarrow q \bar{q} + 1\,jet$. The technique can be extended to several other collision processes of interest as well. This talk is based on the Refs~[1] and [2].
