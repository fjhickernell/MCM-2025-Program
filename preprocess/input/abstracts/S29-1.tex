        This talk will highlight recent improvements to the QMCPy Python package: a unified library for Quasi-Monte Carlo methods and computations related to low discrepancy sequences. We will describe routines for low discrepancy point set generation, randomization, and application to fast kernel methods. Specifically, we will discuss generators for lattices, digital nets, and Halton point sets with randomizations including random permutations / shifts, linear matrix scrambling, and nested uniform scrambling. Routines for working with higher-order digital nets and scramblings will also be detailed. For kernel methods, we provide implementations of special shift-invariant and digitally-shift invariant kernels along with fast Gram matrix operations facilitated by the bit-reversed Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the bit-reversed inverse FFT (IFFT), and the Fast Walsh Hadamard Transform (FWHT). We will also describe methods to quickly update the matrix-vector product or linear system solution after doubling the number of points in a lattice or digital net in natural order. Generalizations to fast Gaussian process regression with derivative information will be discussed if time permits.
