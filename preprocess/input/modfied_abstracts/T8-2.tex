In this manuscript, daily, monthly, and annual geometric Brownian motion forecasts are obtained and tested for reliability upon 21 stock symbols within NASDAQ of varying volatilities and drifts. Biweekly, monthly, biannual, and annual rolling windows were used as a preliminary filtering scheme to remove unreliable stock symbols, and then accuracy was further evaluated on stocks with higher accuracies in the first screening. Annual and 10-year windows were used to estimate the drift and diffusion component and then applied to obtain one-period-ahead geometric Brownian motion stock values and associated probabilities. Further building off of these one-period-ahead values, expected values for 1-252 periods were estimated. Expected values of each stock were estimated by totaling up the product of the stock value and its associated probabilities, and tested over multiple rolling-windows for reliability. The results indicate that geometric Brownian-simulated expected index values estimated using one thousand simulations can be slightly reliable if catered and re-optimized to specific stock characterizations, but only for a daily window, and even then only slightly preferable to flipping a coin. Expected values estimated with less than 100 simulations were thrown out, seen as unreliable.
