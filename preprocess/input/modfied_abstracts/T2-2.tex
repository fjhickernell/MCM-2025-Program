Fractional diffusion equations (FDEs) are powerful tools for modeling anomalous diffusion in complex systems, such as fractured media and biological processes, where nonlocal dynamics and spatial heterogeneity are prominent. These equations provide a more accurate representation of such systems compared to classical models but pose significant computational challenges, particularly for spatially varying diffusivity and fractional orders. In this talk I will present a Bayesian inverse problem for FDEs in a 2-dimensional bounded domain with an anomaly of unknown geometric and physical properties, where the latter are the diffusivity and fractional order fields. To tackle the computational burden of solving dense and ill-conditioned systems, we employ an advanced finite-element scheme incorporating low-rank matrix representations and hierarchical matrices. For parameter estimation, we implement two surrogate-based approaches using polynomial chaos expansions: one constructs a 7-dimensional surrogate for simultaneous inference of geometrical and physical parameters, while the other leverages solution singularities to separately infer geometric features, then constructing a 2-dimensional surrogate to learn the physical parameters and hence reducing the computational cost immensely. These surrogates are used inside a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to infer the unknown parameters.
