Combinatorial discrepancy theory studies the following question: given a universe of elements $U=\{1,\ldots, n\}$ and a collection $\mathcal{S} = \{S_1, \ldots, S_m\}$ of subsets of $U$, how well can we partition $U$ into two pieces, so that all sets in $\mathcal{S}$ are split as evenly as possible.
%Discrepancy theory studies the irregularities of distributions. Typical questions studied in discrepancy theory include: ``What is the most uniform way of distributing $n$ points in the unit square, and how big must the irregularity be?", ``What is the best way to divide a set of $n$ objects into two groups that are as 'similar' as possible?" 
The study of this question has found extensive applications to many areas of mathematics, computer science, statistics, finance, etc. 

The past decade has seen tremendous progress in designing efficient algorithms for this problem. These developments have led to many surprising applications in areas such as differential privacy, graph sparsification, approximation algorithms and rounding, kernel density estimation, randomized controlled trials, and quasi-Monte Carlo methods.

In this talk, I will briefly survey some recent algorithmic developments in this area.
