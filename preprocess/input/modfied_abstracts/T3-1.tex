This work presents a novel approach to solving time-distributed order fractional nonhomogeneous differential equations using the Monte Carlo simulation method. Fractional differential equations with distributed orders are critical for modeling complex systems with memory and hereditary effects, such as viscoelastic materials, anomalous diffusion, and biological processes. The inclusion of time-distributed orders introduces additional challenges in analytical and numerical solutions, especially in the presence of nonhomogeneous terms.

The proposed Monte Carlo method reformulates the distributed order fractional equation into an equivalent integral representation. By simulating random processes and utilizing probabilistic interpretations of fractional operators, the solution is computed as a average over numerous realizations. The flexibility of Monte Carlo simulations makes them particularly well-suited for addressing the inherent complexity of distributed order systems.

Numerical experiments validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the Monte Carlo approach, illustrating its capability to handle various distributed order kernels and nonhomogeneous terms. This method offers a robust, scalable, and versatile framework for solving fractional differential equations, paving the way for broader applications in science and engineering.
