The Heston model is a widely used stochastic volatility model for option pricing, addressing the limitations of the Black-Scholes model by incorporating a stochastic variance process. This talk will cover the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) governing the Heston model, demonstrating their application in option pricing. 

The Heston model introduces a stochastic process for volatility, improving the accuracy of derivative pricing. 
The dynamics of the asset price $S_t$ and its variance $v_t$ under the Heston model are given by[1]:
\begin{align}
    dS_t &= \mu S_t dt + \sqrt{v_t} S_t dW_t^S, \\
    dv_t &= \kappa(\theta - v_t) dt + \sigma \sqrt{v_t} dW_t^v,
\end{align}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mu$ is the drift of the asset price.
    \item $\kappa$ is the rate of mean reversion of variance $v_t$ towards long-term mean $\theta$.
    \item $\sigma$ represents the volatility of volatility.
    \item $dW_t^S$ and $dW_t^v$ are Wiener processes with correlation $\rho$.
\end{itemize}

We will explore Monte Carlo methods as a numerical approach to simulate price paths and compute option prices for European and American derivatives [2],[3]. Furthermore, an interactive Shiny web application will be presented, showcasing real-time simulations and visualizations of option pricing under the Heston framework.

An interactive web-based application is implemented using Shiny in R, enabling users to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adjust input parameters ($S_0, K, r, T, \mu, \theta, \kappa, \sigma, \rho$).
    \item Perform Monte Carlo simulations to compute option prices.
    \item Visualize option price distributions and convergence results.
\end{itemize}

The Shiny application offers an interactive tool for financial analysis. Future work may explore enhancements such as incorporating jump-diffusion models and GPU-accelerated simulations.
