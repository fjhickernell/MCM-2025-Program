UV-Vis spectroscopy is one of the most widely used techniques for identifying and quantifying substances in water and other solvents due to its speed and reliability. Its applications span diverse scientific fields, including chemistry, biochemistry, and medicine, as well as industrial sectors such as the pharmaceutical and food industries. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in environmental monitoring, particularly in assessing water quality. While alternative methods such as Raman and Ring Down spectroscopy have emerged, the core design of UV-Vis spectrometers has remained largely unchanged since their inception. Typically, these instruments employ a light source, a monochromator, a standard 1 cm cuvette as the sample holder, and one or more photosensors.

In this work, we present a novel approach that leverages Monte Carlo simulation to optimize the design of the sample holder for enhanced UV-Vis spectroscopy. In particular, our setup adopts a pulsed light source and a Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) with single-photon counting capability. Using the optical transport package available in the Geant4 toolkit, we characterized and optimized the new design. The innovative holder, crafted in PTFE for its high UV reflectivity, resembles an integrating sphere, which increases the photon path length in the solution and thereby enhances absorbance in the presence of absorbing substances. We also present a comparison between experimental data and Monte Carlo predictions for validation. With this new sample holder, the spectrophotometer exhibits enhanced detection sensitivity, especially at low concentrations.
