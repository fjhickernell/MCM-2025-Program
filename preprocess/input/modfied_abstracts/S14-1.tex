Estimating the symbol error rate (SER) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detectors involves computing an integral in a high-dimensional space, typically outside the Voronoi region of the transmitted symbol. Since a closed-form solution does not exist, the standard approach relies on crude Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which become highly inefficient in rare-event regimes.  In this talk, we propose a multiple importance sampling (MIS) method that provides unbiased SER estimates with significantly reduced variance compared to naive MC. The method constructs an adaptive mixture proposal distribution, where the number of components, their parameters, and weights are selected automatically. This flexibility ensures robustness across a range of scenarios, making the method efficient, easy to implement, and theoretically sound. Our simulations demonstrate that SERs as low as $10^{-8}$ can be accurately estimated with just $10^4$ samples, achieving multiple orders of magnitude improvement over standard MC.
