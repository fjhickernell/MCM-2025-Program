        In this work, we analyze the convergence rate of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods under Owen's boundary growth condition (Owen, 2006) via spectral analysis. We examine the RQMC estimator variance for two commonly studied sequences—the lattice rule and the Sobol' sequence—using the Fourier transform and Walsh–Fourier transform, respectively. Under certain regularity conditions, our results reveal that the asymptotic convergence rate of the RQMC estimator's variance closely aligns with the exponent specified in Owen's boundary growth condition for both sequence types. We also provide an analysis for certain discontinuous integrands.

        In addition, we investigate the \(L^p\) integrability of weak mixed first-order derivatives of the integrand and study the convergence rates of scrambled digital nets. We demonstrate that the generalized Vitali variation with parameter \(\alpha \in \left[\frac{1}{2}, 1\right]\) from Dick and Pillichshammer (2010) is bounded above by the \(L^p\) norm of the weak mixed first-order derivative, where \(p = \frac{2}{3-2\alpha}\). Consequently, when the weak mixed first-order derivative belongs to \(L^p\) for \(1 \leq p \leq 2\), the variance of the scrambled digital nets estimator converges at a rate of
        \(
        \mathcal{O}\Bigl(N^{-4+\frac{2}{p}} \log^{s-1} N\Bigr).
        \)
        Together, these results provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the convergence behavior of RQMC methods and scrambled digital nets under various regularity assumptions.
