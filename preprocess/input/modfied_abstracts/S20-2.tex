Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or A/B tests are the ``gold standard" for estimating the causal effects of new treatments. In a trial, we want to randomly assign experimental units into two groups so that certain unit-specific pre-treatment variables, called covariates, are balanced across different groups. Balancing covariates improves causal effect estimates if covariates correlate with treatment outcomes. Simultaneously, we want our assignment of the units to be robust or sufficiently random such that our estimate is not bad if covariates do not correlate with treatment outcomes. We will show a close connection between the design of RCTs and discrepancy theory and how recent advances in algorithmic discrepancy theory could improve the design of RCTs.
