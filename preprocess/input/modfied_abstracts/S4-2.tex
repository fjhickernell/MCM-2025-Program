Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) is a computational method that reduces the cost of Monte Carlo simulations by combining SDE approximations with multiple resolutions. A further avenue for significantly reducing cost and improving power efficiency of MLMC, notably for financial option pricing, is the use of low precision calculations on configurable hardware devices such as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). With this goal in mind, in this talk we propose a new MLMC framework that exploits approximate random variables and fixed-point operations with optimised precision to compute most SDE paths with a lower cost.

For the generation of random Normal increments, we discuss several methods based on the approximation of the inverse normal CDF (see e.g. [3]), and we argue that these methods could be implemented on FPGAs using small Look-Up-Tables to generate random numbers more efficiently than on CPUs or GPUs. 

To set the bit-width of variables in the path generation we propose a rounding error model and optimise the precision of all variables on each Monte Carlo level. This optimisation stage is independent of the desired overall accuracy, and can therefore be performed off-line. 

With these two key improvements, our proposed framework [2] offers higher computational
savings than the existing mixed-precision MLMC framework [1].
