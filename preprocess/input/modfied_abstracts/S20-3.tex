A recent line of work, initiated by a paper of Bansal and Spencer [2], has made remarkable progress in developing online algorithms for combinatorial discrepancy minimization. In the online discrepancy minimization model, the algorithm receives a sequence of elements of some set system, or, more generally, a sequence of vectors, to color. The new element/vector must be colored immediately upon being received. We now have online algorithms that nearly match some important (offline) discrepancy bounds when the sequence of elements/vectors is stochastic or oblivious: examples include Spencer's theorem [2], and Banaszczyk's theorem [1,3]. In this work, we explore if the factorization method for discrepancy minimization [4] can also be adapted to the offline setting. We introduce a model of online factorization of matrices, and, as a case study, show how to factor online the incidence matrix of a collection of $n$ halfspaces in $d$ dimensions. As a result, we obtain an online algorithm to color an oblivious sequence of $T$ points in $d$ dimensions, so that the discrepancy with respect to a pre-specified collection of $n$ halfspaces is on the order of $n^{\frac12 - \frac{1}{2d}}$ up to logarithmic terms.
