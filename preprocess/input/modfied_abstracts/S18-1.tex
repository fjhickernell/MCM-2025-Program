I will introduce the Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) framework for automatically tuning Metropolis algorithms and apply it to locally adapting the number of steps, step size, and mass matrix in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC).  After resampling momentum, each iteration of GIST Gibbs samples tuning parameters based on the current position and momentum.  Like with HMC, the Metropolis step for the Hamiltonian proposal is adjusted for the Gibbs sampling.

I will demonstrate how randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), multinomial HMC, the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), and the Apogee-to-Apogee Sampler can be cast as GIST samplers that adapt the number of steps.  I will then introduce an approach to tuning step size that can be naturally combined with NUTS and demonstrate its effectiveness empirically on both multivariate normal and multiscale distributions with varying curvature.  

I will sketch an approach to local mass matrix adaptation, demonstrate how it works for log concave distributions, then outline the problems remaining for efficiency and generalizability to other distributions.
