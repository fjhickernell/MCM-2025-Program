 Nested expectations
 arise in many applications, such as in engineering, mathematical finance, and medical decision-making. In addition to their nested structure, numerical estimations of such expectations are often complicated by singularities or discontinuities. Moreover, approximations when evaluating inner expectations using, for example, finite element or time-stepping schemes render traditional estimation methods such as double-loop Monte Carlo prohibitively expensive. This session will explore models and applications with this structure and methods for efficient estimation.

 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a cornerstone optimization method in machine learning,
 renowned for its efficiency in handling large-scale data. Its iterative approach enables
 the processing of extensive datasets by updating model parameters using randomly selected
 data subsets, thereby reducing computational costs. Despite its widespread adoption, traditional
 SGD faces challenges such as convergence to sharp minima, and sensitivity to data
 distribution shifts. Addressing these challenges is crucial for enhancing model generalization,
 robustness, and overall performance in diverse applications. This session aims to delve into
 recent developments that address these challenges in SGD, presenting innovative methodologies
 and theoretical insights to enhance its effectiveness in complex learning scenarios.
 The session will have three to four speakers. Currently, the confirmed speakers are Jose
 Blanchet (Stanford University), Chang-Han Rhee (Northwestern University), and Jing Dong
 (Columbia University). Each will present their recent works on stochastic gradient descent,
 ranging from SGD and heavy-tailed phenomenon to SGD with adaptively generated data.
 Collectively, these talks will shed light on cutting-edge advancements in SGD methodologies,
 providing both theoretical frameworks and practical strategies to enhance optimization in
 complex, real-world applications.
