We consider adaptive increasingly rare Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which is an adaptive MCMC method, where an adaptation concerning the ``past" takes place less and less often over time. We investigate the convergence behaviour of renormalised Monte Carlo sums and show limit theorems which hold under a Wasserstein contraction assumption. Our results hold in an almost sure setting and we obtain rates which are close to those in a law of the iterated logarithm. As a consequence we are able to deduce a quantitative strong law of large numbers for the adaptive increasingly rare MCMC path average estimator.
