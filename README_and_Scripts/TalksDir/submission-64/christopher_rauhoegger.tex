We consider $d$-dimensional systems of SDEs with drift coefficient $\mu$ and Lipschitz continuous diffusion coefficient $\sigma$. We assume that there exists a $C^{5}$-hypersurface
$\Theta\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that $\mu$ is intrinsic Lipschitz continuous on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\setminus \Theta$ and such that $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are $C^{1}$ with intrinsic Lipschitz continuous derivatives on $\mathbb{R}^{d}\setminus \Theta$. 

It was recently proven in [1] that for SDEs of this type in the case $d = 1$ a Milstein-type scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $3/4$. Furthermore it was proven in [2] that in the same setting an adaptive
Milstein-type scheme achieves an $L_{p}$-error rate of order at least $1$. 
For general $d \in \mathbb{N}$, no strong error result for schemes of this type was known until recently.
In this talk we will present for $d \in \mathbb{N}$ Milstein-type schemes which can be used for the approximation 
of the solutions of such systems of SDEs at the final time point and we will analyse their convergence rates.
