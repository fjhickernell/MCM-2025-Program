    Sampling algorithms based on piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs) have incited much interest in the Monte Carlo community as an alternative to traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Their non-reversible nature, and the ability to admit sub-sampling strategies without introducing bias, offer much promise for efficient and scalable Monte Carlo simulation. The Zig-Zag sampler [1], based on the multi-dimensional Zig-Zag process has been shown to exhibit nice theoretical properties e.g. geometric ergodicity, large deviations, high dimensional scaling limits, to name a few. In settings of Bayesian inference (consisting of $n$ observations, say), it admits sub-sampling versions which offer significant benefits, reducing computational effort per independent sample from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$ in some situations. 

    However, sub-sampling itself costs a positive excess switching rate of $O(n)$. This has two problems. First, the computational bounds needed for Poisson thinning may increase causing more proposed switches per unit time, thus increasing the algorithmic complexity of the sampler. Second, a positive excess rate induces diffusivity in the underlying Zig-Zag process. This causes the process to slow down and negatively affects its mixing properties. 

    We address the second problem by investigating the affects of sub-sampling on process dynamics as the data size $n$ goes to infinity. We study the behaviour of Zig-Zag with sub-sampling (ZZ-SS) and sub-sampling using control variates (ZZ-CV). In the transient phase, by averaging out the fluctuations in the velocity process, we establish weak convergence of the position process to the solution of a deterministic ODE. In the stationary phase, after appropriate re-scaling, we prove the convergence of ZZ-SS and ZZ-CV to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and to a PDMP respectively. Our results show that in the stationary phase, ZZ-CV mixes as fast as the canonical Zig-Zag and ZZ-SS mixes no slower than a factor $n^{1/2}$. In the transient phase, ZZ-SS and ZZ-CV have the same speed with ZZ-SS performing better for heavy tailed models.
