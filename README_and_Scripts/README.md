MCQMC2024Data.xlsx
-important sheets
A) schedule: need to input session schedule (in blue, top left corner); I believe columns G,H,I were also written in "manually" i.e copy & paste blocks of 4 rows for G and H, then just index them in column I
B) MCQMC2024Data: columns A to E came from spreadsheet of submissions obtained from Greg, with mostly manual assignment of talks to sessions for COLUMN D; column F requires info from sheet OrderSpeakerSpec and column J requires info from SubmFolderNb
C) TalkListAsValue: copy of  MCQMC2024Data appropriately sorted
D) ChronTalkList: copy of MCQMC2024Data appropriately sorted
E) OrderSpeakerSpec: some of this was extracted from special session submission info; for contributed sessions we ordered randomly
F) SubmFolderNb: had to tweak this manually but these numbers (column A) were generated by web form, and in some cases I had to create a folder (lost submissions)
