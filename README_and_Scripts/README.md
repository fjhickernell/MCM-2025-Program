## Python Programs

1.   **`MCMBookSessionDesc.py`**
    
*   Inputs:
    *   `MCM2025Data.xlsx`: An **Excel file**, specifically drawing information from the **"TalkListAsValue" 
        sheet**. This sheet lists talks ordered by sessions and then by speaker.
    *   `TalksDir/submission-xx`: **Latex abstract files** located within a directory structure, where `xx` is a 
        number read from a CSV file. The name of the Latex file is also read from the CSV.
*   Outputs:
    *   `out/sessXX.tex`: A **Latex file for each session**, where `XX` represents the session label (e.g., CS1 
        for Contributed Session 1 or SS3 for Special Session 3). These files are used by the program book.
    *   `out/listabstract.tex`: A **Latex file containing the list of abstracts** with appropriate labels. This 
        file is also used in the program book.

2.   **`MakeLatexScheduleMCM.py`**
*   Inputs:
       *   `MCM2025Data.xlsx`: An **Excel file**, specifically using the **"ChronTalkList" sheet**. This sheet 
           contains a list of talks ordered chronologically by time and then by session.
       *   `SessionList.csv`: A **CSV file** that lists sessions ordered chronologically and then by 
           room number or columns in the schedule table. It contains 10 columns. The header of the csv is likely to be:
           `SessionID,SessionTitle,IsSpecialSession,Organizer1,Organizer2,Organizer3,Chair,SessionTime,Room,OrderInSchedule`
*   Outputs:
       *    `Schedule.tex`: A **Latex file** that contains the coloured schedule for the program book.

3.   **`BuildHtmlScheduleMCM.py`**
*   Inputs:
          *   `PlenTitle.csv`: A **CSV file**, containing a list of plenary titles.
          *   `SessionListMCM.csv`: A **CSV file**, which lists sessions ordered chronologically and then by 
              room number or columns in the schedule table.
          *   `MCM2025Data.xlsx`: An **Excel file**, using the **"TalkListAsValue" sheet**.
*   Outputs:
       *   `TableSchedule.html` An **HTML file**, containing the schedule for the conference webpage.

4.   **`MakeListPart.py`**
*   Inputs:
       *   `PARTICIPANTSJULY5.csv`: A **CSV file** which contains the list of participants. It contains five columns: 
           `FirstName`, `LastName`, `SessionID`, `UNKNOWN`, and `Affiliation`. 

*   Outputs:
    *   `Participants.tex`: A **Latex file**, containing the list of participants with references to the page 
        number for their talk.

## MCM2025Data.xlsx

`MCM2025Data.xlsx` is an **Excel file** that serves as a primary **input** source for several Python programs used to generate materials for the MCM 2025 conference. It contains various sheets with information about the conference schedule, talks, and submissions, used to create the program book and the conference webpage schedule.

Several "important sheets" within the `MCM2025Data.xlsx` file:

*   **`schedule`**: This sheet needs the session schedule information manually input. Specifically, the part described as being in the "blue, top left corner". Columns G, H, and I also involved manual entry or copy-pasting blocks of rows.
*   **`MCM2025Data`**: The data in columns A through E of this sheet originated from a spreadsheet of submissions provided by someone named Greg. Manual work was involved in assigning talks to sessions, particularly in Column D. Column F uses information from the `OrderSpeakerSpec` sheet, and Column J uses information from the `SubmFolderNb` sheet.
*   **`TalkListAsValue`**: This sheet is described as a copy of `MCM2025Data` that is "appropriately sorted". It is used by the `MCMBookSessionDesc.py` program, which expects it sorted by session order (Column H) and then by speaker within the session (Column F). It is also used by the `BuildHtmlScheduleMCM.py` program, which assumes the rows are listed by session. The `MakeLatexScheduleMCM.py` program also reads from this sheet, assuming the rows are listed in chronological order of the conference.
*   **`ChronTalkList`**: This sheet is also described as a copy of `MCM2025Data` that is "appropriately sorted". The `MakeLatexScheduleMCM.py` program uses this sheet and expects the list of talks to be ordered chronologically, meaning by time and then by session.
*   **`OrderSpeakerSpec`**: This sheet contains information partly extracted from special session submission details. For contributed sessions, the speakers were ordered randomly in this sheet. Information from this sheet is needed for Column F in the `MCM2025Data` sheet.
*   **`SubmFolderNb`**: The numbers in Column A of this sheet were generated by a web form. This sheet required manual adjustments, and folders had to be created for "lost submissions" based on this information. Information from this sheet is needed for Column J in the `MCM2025Data` sheet.
